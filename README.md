# Geneus UI theme

Geneus is an adaptable UI theme for Atom, based on [Nucleus code](https://atom.io/themes/nucleus-dark-ui), which uses your favorite syntax coloring at its core! This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use. But Geneus also adds a configurable **Focus Mode** based on the one present in the [Genesis theme](https://atom.io/themes/genesis-ui)

## Statement

This is a fork of the [Immersive Nuclues Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/immersive-nucleus-dark-ui), with some changes with code taken from [Genesis UI](https://atom.io/themes/genesis-ui).

All code belongs to their respective owner, I just combined them in a useful theme

## Installation

Inside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Geneus.

Or install directly from the console:

`apm install geneus-ui`
